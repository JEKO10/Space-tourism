## Project task

This is the Frontend mentor challenge. The challenge is to build out a multi-page space tourism website and get it looking as close to the design as possible. These were the beginnings of my front-end development learning :).

Your users can:
- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

## Project overview

The home page displays a background image of our beautiful Earth, some text, and a big aesthetic button. The second page displays available destinations and information about them. The other two pages display information about crew and technology. There are three of each.

## Built with
